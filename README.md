# Installation Guide
## Installing ROS melodic

Following this page: http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu. The installation must under Ubuntu 18.04 lts

### Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org. :

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

### Set up your keys
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
```

### Installation
First, make sure your Debian package index is up-to-date:
```
sudo apt update
```

### Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended) : ROS, rqt, rviz, robot-generic libraries, 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
```

### Initialize rosdep
Before you can use ROS, you will need to initialize rosdep. rosdep enables you to easily install system dependencies for source you want to compile and is required to run some core components in ROS.
```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Environment setup
It's convenient if the ROS environment variables are automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched:
```
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Dependencies for building packages
Up to now you have installed what you need to run the core ROS packages. To create and manage your own ROS workspaces, there are various tools and requirements that are distributed separately. For example, rosinstall is a frequently used command-line tool that enables you to easily download many source trees for ROS packages with one command.
To install this tool and other dependencies for building ROS packages, run:
``` 
sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
```

# Install Prerequisites
Please install all the prerequisites, no matter which algorithm you want to use.
## Easy Install Prerequisites
### catking tools
First you must have the ROS repositories which contain the .deb for catkin_tools:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```
Once you have added that repository, run these commands to install catkin_tools:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
```
### Eigen3
Required by g2o. Download and install instructions can be found here. Otherwise Eigen can be installed as a binary with:
```
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```
### ffmpeg
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
### Python catkin tools (probably already installed)
```
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
```
### Joystick drivers
Tested it only on melodic.
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-joystick-drivers
```
### Python PIL
```
sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk
```
## Github based Prerequisites
### Pangolin (used in orbslam2)
Based on https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin
```
cd ~/ROS/

# Get Pangolin
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
sudo apt install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install libxkbcommon-dev
cd Pangolin 

# Install dependencies (as described above, or your preferred method)
./scripts/install_prerequisites.sh recommended

# Configure and build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# GIVEME THE PYTHON STUFF!!!! (Check the output to verify selected python version)
cmake --build . -t pypangolin_pip_install

```

### h264decoder
Baed on https://github.com/DaWelter/h264decoder
```
cd ~/ROS/
git clone https://github.com/DaWelter/h264decoder.git
```
Inside h264decoder.cpp replace PIX_FMT_RGB24 with AV_PIX_FMT_RGB24
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
now copy it to python path
```
sudo cp ~/ROS/h264decoder/libh264decoder.so /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
```
# Installing Our Repository
## Cloning Our repo from github
```
cd ~
mkdir ROS
cd ROS
git clone https://github.com/tau-adl/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM.git
```
## Installing our version of TelloPy
based on https://github.com/dji-sdk/Tello-Python and https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/TelloPy
sudo python setup.py install
```
## Installing dependencies for ROS
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/tello_catkin_ws/
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

# Installing orbslam2
Change the code of orbslam2

## Getting the code
Clone the repository into your catkin workspace:
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/tello_catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/orb_slam_2_ros.git
```

## Build the code:
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/tello_catkin_ws
catkin init
catkin clean
catkin build
```
If it doesnâ€™t work, make sure you changed the makefile to the wanted version of ROS
## Add the enviroment setup to bashrc
```
echo "source $PWD/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
# Installing ccm_slam


##Clone the source repo into your catkin workspace src folder:
```
cd ~/ccmslam_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/ccm_slam.git
```

##Compile *DBoW2*:
```
cd ~/ccmslam_ws/src/ccm_slam/cslam/thirdparty/DBoW2/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

##Compile *g2o*:
```
cd ~/ccmslam_ws/src/ccm_slam/cslam/thirdparty/g2o
mkdir build
cd build
cmake --cmake-args -DG2O_U14=0 ..
make -j8
```

##Unzip *Vocabulary*:
```
cd ~/ccmslam_ws/src/ccm_slam/cslam/conf
unzip ORBvoc.txt.zip
```

## Build the code:
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/ccmslam_ws/
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/melodic
catkin build ccmslam --cmake-args -DG2O_U14=0 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

If Gives error -  ROS distro neither indigo nor kinetic - change the makefile, use CmakeFile_changed2.
## Add the enviroment setup to bashrc
```
echo "source $PWD/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Notes
